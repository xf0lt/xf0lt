      <p>I am a student currently studying Economic Management, with a
        passion for cybersecurity and linux. This is my personal blog site,
        which I set up with a view to document my journey learning cybersecurity
        through articles on topics I learn. Besides the site will also hold some
        other tech stuff that I might be interested in and take up as a
        project.</p>
        <p>This blog has been setup as a means of documenting my journey in the
        field and also to write posts on my findings and learnings, as I
        beleive, documenting what I do or learn is much helpful to me to have a
        clear understanding of the topic in scope, and also it might help
        others. Another main aim of mine is to post writeups on the various
        challenges, CTFs that I will be solving. A lot can be learnt through
        these. These will help me as well as others who might be looking for
        some materials to get going in the competiotions.</p>
        <p>So, stay plugged in, and</p>
